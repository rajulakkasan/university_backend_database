University Database Management System

Introduction:
The University Database Management System (DBMS) is a web-based application designed to manage various aspects of a university, including student enrollment, course scheduling, professor information, and academic performance tracking. This project aims to streamline administrative tasks, improve communication between stakeholders, and enhance the overall efficiency of university operations.

Features:

User Authentication: The system supports user authentication to ensure secure access to different functionalities based on user roles. Users can log in with their credentials (username and password) and access features based on their roles (admin, professor, student).
Dashboard: Upon logging in, users are directed to a dashboard that provides an overview of relevant information based on their role. Admins have access to administrative tools, professors can view course-related information, and students can access academic resources.
Course Management: Admins can manage courses, including adding new courses, updating course details, and deleting courses. They can also assign professors to teach specific courses and manage course prerequisites.
Professor Management: The system allows admins to manage professor information, including adding new professors, updating their details, and assigning them to teach courses. Admins can also track performance metrics for professors.
Student Management: Admins can manage student enrollment, including adding new students, updating student records, and assigning courses to students. The system tracks student academic performance, including grades, GPA, and course history.
Class Scheduling: Admins can create class schedules for each semester, assign classrooms, and manage class timings. Professors and students can view their class schedules and access relevant course materials.
Reporting: The system generates reports on various aspects of university operations, including enrollment statistics, course performance, and faculty evaluations. Reports can be exported in different formats for analysis and decision-making.

Technologies Used:

Django: The web application is built using the Django web framework, which provides a robust foundation for building scalable and maintainable web applications.
HTML/CSS: Frontend user interfaces are designed using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user experience.
Bootstrap: The Bootstrap CSS framework is used for responsive design, layout grids, and styling components to achieve a consistent and modern UI.
JavaScript: Client-side interactivity and dynamic content loading are implemented using JavaScript to enhance user experience and improve usability.
SQLite: The SQLite database management system is used for storing and managing relational data, providing efficient data storage and retrieval capabilities.
